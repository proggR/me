                        <dd>I am the developer and founder of a social crowdfunding and sales platform for music industry professionals called sourced.fm. In addition to funding projects directly from fans, sourced.fm includes social features that enable users to share content on the platform, allows artists and promoters to manage their show schedules, and soon will have shops as part of artist profiles in order for them to sell their content easily with no overhead. All work is done in an OSX/LAMP environment and the platform has been developed with RESTful API patterns in mind.</dd>

                        <dd>I work as a web developer at Queen's University developing for an open source learning platform called Entrada. Here, I have been responsible for supporting installations for three of the four schools that use our software within the Faculty of Health Sciences. I model and develop features with a team based on feedback received from our users. Some projects I have been involved with include: adding support for multiple organizations including per organisation settings, objective lists, event topics, etc; adding event attendance tracking featuring the ability to capture attendance via a card reader; the addition of an assignment submission and conversation system; an update to our objective tracking system to make it more flexible and intuitive to use; and the development of a script used to sync our users with the University's LDAP server. All work is done in an OSX/LAMP environment. I have minimal experience with Zend Framework, which has been used on a handful of projects within our unit.</dd>

                        <dd>While at the Ministry of Health, I was responsible for developing a proof of concept for a web service that would mediate between health care providers and the Ministry's mainframe. The service included RESTful endpoints which would store submissions in a message queue so they could be transferred to the mainframe and processed in batch. This work was done in a Windows, z/OS, Java, and WebSphere environment. While at the Ministry, I also worked on scripts to help automate aspects of inventory management within our department. </dd>

                        <dd>For the first three years I worked at Stream, I was on a contract for Roadrunner, a US based internet service provider. Here I troubleshot issues related to slow or missing internet connections, email problems, firewall configuration issues, basic hosting support, and a number of other service related issues. Shortly before leaving for school, Roadrunner transferred to another call center and I transferred contracts to HP to support their all-in-one printer lines. Here I installed and configured printer software, troubleshot print and fax issues, and sold printer related supplies and warranties to interested callers.</dd>

I am most familiar with PHP, MySQL, HTML, jQuery/Javascript, and CSS, but I have experience with a handful of additional languages and enjoy learning new things and applying existing knowledge in new contexts. I am also familiar with and regularly use git. This page can be cloned on <a href="http://github.com/proggR/me">GitHub</a>.

                        I enjoy being involved in projects that require data modeling, including new applications or features with data and business requirements that need to be abstracted into properly normalized databases, well organized APIs, and extensible code. I also enjoy planning interfaces that simplify interactions for the end user while still providing easy access to the most relevant information.

                        I've had a lifelong curiosity about business, going back to meeting and becoming close with my friend's self employed parents in grade four. I was one course shy of graduating high school with a business certificate but didn't want to take the remaining accounting course. In an almost karmic fashion accounting was a required course in my college program.

                        Non-tech specific interests include hiking, camping, self-sufficient lifestyles, crowdsourcing/crowdfunding, reading, and keeping up-to-date on information for all kinds of news, events, products and industries. I'm an information addict and love learning new things about everything I can every day.
